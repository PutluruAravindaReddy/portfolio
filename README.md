## About

This portfolio contains a collection of my personal and professional projects, demonstrating my skills in front-end and back-end development, project management, and various web technologies. Each project includes a brief description, the technologies used, and a link to view the project live.

I am Aravinda Reddy P, a dedicated computer science student with a robust background in full-stack development. I have demonstrated my technical proficiency and innovative mindset by winning the IEEE SRMIST Tech Trek Hackathon. My expertise spans front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, as well as back-end development with Node.js and MongoDB. Additionally, I am proficient in Java and currently practicing data structures and algorithms (DSA). I am skilled in utilizing APIs and cloud services, including Google API and Cloudinary. Currently, I am contributing to a web development project for the Computer Vision Lab at SRM University using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. As an active member of the IEEE SRMIST SB club, I am committed to continuous learning and eager to apply my skills to solve complex problems and deliver high-quality solutions.
